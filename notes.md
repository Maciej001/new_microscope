## Spacebars partials

**Inclucisions** `{{> templateName}}` - replace with the template of the same name

**Expressions** `{{title}}` - call a property of current object or return value of a template helper

**Block helpers** tags that control the flow of the template, such as 
    `{{#each}}`...`{{/each}}` 

The `{{#each}}`
block helper not only iterates over our array, it also sets the value of `this`inside the block to the iterated object.

`meteor shell` - gives you direct access to you app's server-side code

`meteor mongo` - gives you access to your app's database (Mongo Console)
`meteor mongo myApp` - you can access your deployed app's Mongo shell with it
`meteor reset` - to reset the database

```
> db.posts.insert({title: "A new post"});
> db.posts.find();
```

Client side database implementation is called **MiniMongo**

### Find and Fetch
`find()` - returns cursor, which is a reactive data source. When we want to log it's contents, we can use:
`fetch()` - on that cursor to transform it into an array

Within an app, Meteor iterates over cursors without having to convert them into arrays first.

`meteor remove autopublish` - each collection should be shared in its entirety to each connected client. Remove it to stop the automatic behaviour.

### Publications
In server catalogue create publications.js and add what collections you want to be published. 
`Meteor.publish('posts', function() { return Posts.find(); } );`

on client side we need need to subscribe to the publications in client/main.js
`Meteor.subscribe('posts');`

to publish eg. only not flagged posts:
```
Meteor.publish('posts', function(){
        return Posts.find({flagged: false});
    });
```

We need a way for clients to specify which subset of that data they need at any particular moment, and thatâ€™s exactly where subscriptions come in.
Any data you subsciribe to will be mirrored on the client thanks to Minimongo.

Let's say we want just to subscribe to **all** Bob Smith's posts:

on the server side:
```
Meteor.publish('posts', function(){
        return Posts.find({flagged: false, author: author})
    });
```

on client side:
```
Meteor.subscribe('posts', 'bob-smith');
```

it loads all Bob's posts, but we want to display only posts form "Javascript" category. So on client side:
```
Template.posts.helpers({
        posts: function() {
            return Posts.find({autor: 'bob-smith', category: 'Javascript'});
        }
    });
```
